IBMOS - Immersed boundary method for optimization and stability analyses
########################################################################

IBMOS is a numerical flow solver writen in python based on the projection-based
immersed boundary method by Taira & Colonius (J. Comp. Phys., 2007). This solver
features the implementation of the linearized equations and their adjoint, as
well as a set of tools that illustrate the application of numerical optimization
methods to fluid flows and their investigation using stability analysis tools.
